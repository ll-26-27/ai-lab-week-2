# Verified commands

Every command below was run for real against its provider on 2026-09-16, with the root `.env` filled in (shown here without `--env-file`, since students keep their key file at the repo root). Costs are what the provider's own response reported; a blank cost means the provider did not report one, not that the call was free.

## openrouter

```bash
node utils/generate-text.mjs openrouter "Reply with the single word HELLO." --model openai/gpt-5-mini
```

Worked. Model `openai/gpt-5-mini`. Cost reported: $0.0001775.

## fal

```bash
node utils/generate-text.mjs fal "Reply with the single word HELLO." --model google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite
```

Worked. `--model` is the language model inside fal's `fal-ai/any-llm` endpoint: `google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite`. Cost: not reported in `response.json`.

## huit-openai

```bash
node utils/generate-text.mjs huit-openai "Reply with the single word HELLO." --model gpt-5-mini
```

```bash
node utils/generate-image.mjs huit-openai "a small red apple on a white background" --model gpt-image-1-mini --size 1024x1024
```

```

Worked. Model `gemini-2.5-flash`. Cost: not reported.

```bash

```

## huit-bedrock

Claude through Harvard's Bedrock gateway. The model id is the Bedrock inference-profile id, which `ll-huit bedrock models` (in `apps/ll-utilities`) lists in full. These six were verified on 2026-09-16 with "Reply with the single word HELLO.":

```bash
node utils/generate-text.mjs huit-bedrock "Reply with the single word HELLO." --model us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-5
```
```bash
node utils/generate-text.mjs huit-bedrock "Reply with the single word HELLO." --model us.anthropic.claude-opus-5
```
```bash
node utils/generate-text.mjs huit-bedrock "Reply with the single word HELLO." --model us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0
```
```bash
node utils/generate-text.mjs huit-bedrock "Reply with the single word HELLO." --model claude-fable-5
```

Also worked: `global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-5`, `global.anthropic.claude-opus-5`, `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6`. `claude-fable-5` is a shortcut the script expands to `global.anthropic.claude-fable-5` on the native Invoke route; every other id goes through the Converse route. Cost: not reported by the gateway.

Known not to work: `us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5` (HTTP 400) and `us.anthropic.claude-3-5-haiku-20241022-v1:0` (HTTP 404). The gateway wants the exact profile id; older Claude ids carry a date and `-v1:0` suffix, the Claude 5 ids do not. Images are not bundled for this gateway; use huit-openai or huit-gemini.

## openrouter transcription (speech to text)

Verified 2026-09-16 on a five-second spoken MP3 made with macOS `say`; all three returned the sentence exactly.

```bash
node utils/transcribe.mjs speech.mp3 --model openai/whisper-large-v3
```

Cost reported: $0.000039.

```bash
node utils/transcribe.mjs speech.mp3 --model openai/whisper-1 --verbose
```

Cost reported: $0.0006. `--verbose` adds language, duration, and timestamped segments to `transcript.md`.

```bash
node utils/transcribe.mjs speech.mp3 --model microsoft/mai-transcribe-2
```

Cost reported: $0.00017. The endpoint takes WAV, MP3, FLAC, M4A, OGG, WebM, and AAC up to 25 MB; longer recordings should be MP3 and, past twenty minutes or so, split with ffmpeg first.
